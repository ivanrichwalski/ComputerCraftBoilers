This is a number of scripts and support libraries for managing Railcraft boilers
in Minecraft.


## fuel-miser ##

	This script monitors boiler temperature, and dispenses fuel a little
	at a time, instead of keeping the boiler's internal fuel tank
	constantly full. This produces slighly better efficiancy, since the
	boiler can "coast" without fuel for short periods of time. Another
	benefit is that if you can shutdown a boiler faster, since you don't
	have to wait for the internal fuel tank to run dry. If the internal
	tank was filled with 16 buckets of fuel, it can which can take
	over 80 minutes with a 36HP boiler, and more than 2 days for a 1LP )
